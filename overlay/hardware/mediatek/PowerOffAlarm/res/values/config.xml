        List of enabled PowerOffAlarm drivers, initialization is attempted in this order.

        - alarm: /dev/alarm legacy driver with MTK modifications, recommended until including 3.X
                 but works until 4.19 for most devices
        - rtc: the method which MTK userspace uses in modern userspace, which cannot properly be
               checked for presence because the IOCTL definition is in kernel .c file, not
               exported to userspace. If this is required for proper operation of power off alarm,
               please overlay this config.
        - timerfd: exists, appears unused in userspace, but the only thing we can programatically
                   detect at build time (using device kernel headers), so this is preffered.
